Someone who enjoys living in a quite place with a park and sport complex nearby might want to live in a neighborhood with a similar vibe, yet in another city or even a country. \n Thus, it will be convenient for people willing to relocate, to compare the neighborhoods of the city they are going to with neighborhoods of the city they currently live in - service, providing such help, might be included in a bigger mapping/navigation platform or exist independantly\n The present notebook is an example of comparison between the neighborhoods of two cities, namely Saint Petersburg and Berlin - both have a status of cultural and educational capitals of their corresponding countries and are similar in metropolitan population and average population density (~6 200 000 inh. and ~4 000 inh./km^2 respectively)    \n <h2><li> Data gathering </li></h2>\n    \nData, used for the project, consists of:\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<h3><li>Name, population and area of each neighborhood for both cities, taken from Wikipedia: </li></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For Saint Petersburg:<a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B0\">Wiki page for Saint Petersburg</a> </li>\n<li>For Berlin:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin\">Wiki page for Berlin</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><li>Foursquare data on venues in each neighborhood, gathered using Foursquare API </li></h3>\n</ol>\n</ol>"
